znsocket documentation
======================

znsocket is a Python and JavaScript library that provides Redis-compatible API using websockets.
It enables real-time synchronization of data structures between multiple clients and supports
distributed applications with automatic reconnection capabilities.

Key features:

- **Distributed data structures**: List, Dict, and Segments that sync across clients
- **Nested structures**: Lists can contain Dicts, Dicts can contain Lists, and Segments work with both
- **Real-time synchronization**: Changes are immediately visible to all connected clients
- **Cross-language support**: Use the same data structures from Python and JavaScript
- **Adapter pattern**: Expose existing data structures through the znsocket interface
